## About

Foley is an 'all-in-one' workflow designed to quickly build a static website and blog using the latest techniques in Frontend development. Use foley as a base and tailor to your specific needs.

This workflow contains the following key features:

* Gulp,
* Metalsmith (with Handlebars templates, Blogging & Markdown support)
* Webpack with jQuery integration,
* Babel with ES2015 support,
* Standardjs linting,
* Sass & PostCSS,
* CSS Stylelint with SUIT ruleset,
* Critical inlined CSS,
* Sass-mq & Susy grid system,
* Image minification,
* Gulp SVG sprite support,
* HTML minification,
* Easy to use with simple Gulp tasks & configuration from global files,

Comments, suggestions & pull requests are always welcome. See the [issues list](https://github.com/fephil/foley/issues) for more information about future enhancements and changes.

## Install

Download the latest stable release from [GitHub](https://github.com/fephil/foley/releases). Once this has been done:

* Install Node 4 LTS or 5 stable (preferred),
* Run in Terminal: `npm i gulp-cli -g` (Gulp does not need to be installed globally),
* Navigate to the workflow folder in command line Terminal,
* Run: `npm i`.

Please note, there are a large amount of development dependencies to install due to the 'all in one' nature of this workflow. It could possibly take several minutes to install the modules.

### Optional Installs

The following plugins for Atom are recommended but not required:

* editorconfig,
* linter,
* linter-handlebars,
* linter-js-standard,
* linter-stylelint,
* tabs-to-spaces.

## Usage

Run these tasks in your command line Terminal:

`gulp [--production] [--debug]`

`gulp deploy [--production] [--debug]`

`gulp auditcode`

* The `gulp` task builds the website, watches for changes and starts up a sever,
* The `gulp deploy` task builds the website without watching for changes or running the server,
* The `gulp auditcode` task runs various linting on the project source files.
* The `--production` flag builds minified assets with no sourcemaps,
* The `--debug` flag shows the files being created in each task (if the task has a pipe).
